      <h1>Happy Birthday, Dewi Xaro</h1>
      <p>Happy special birthday! Today is the day to celebrate your extraordinary existence. In the journey of life, I am grateful to have you by my side.</p>
      <p>Between seas, galaxies, and moons, I was lucky I stepped on the same land, I dreamed under the same stars as you.</p>
      <p>Some people are born with tornadoes in their lives, but constellations in their eyes. Other people are born with stars at their feet, but their souls are lost at sea. All I wanted to say is stay true to yourself, you're beautiful the way you are.</p>
      <p>Who cares about perfection? Even the moon isn't perfect, it's full of craters. The sea is incredibly beautiful but salty and dark in the depths. The sky is always infinite but often cloudy. So everything that beautiful isn't perfect. It's Special.</p>
      <p>May this year be a chapter filled with happiness, success, and love. Thank you for being a part of my life's story. Happy birthday, and may each of your days be filled with extraordinary joy and achievements!</p>
      <p>Please be happy and live a long life 🎉🎂.</p>
